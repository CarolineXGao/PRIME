        excerpt: "We know that climate change is more than an environmental crisis â€” it's also a mental health challenge. Our new commentary calls for urgent action to close the gap between what young people are experiencing and the slow pace of research and policy responses.",
        fullContent: `We know that climate change is more than an environmental crisis â€” it's also a mental health challenge. Young people, in particular, are experiencing rising levels of anxiety, grief and hopelessness in the face of floods, bushfires, heatwaves and ongoing climate uncertainty.

Our new commentary, published in the Journal of Applied Youth Studies, calls for urgent action to close the gap between what young people are experiencing and the slow pace of research and policy responses.

We highlight that:

â€¢ Young people are disproportionately affected by climate-related disasters and exclusion from decision-making.

â€¢ Youth-specific interventions are rare, and translating research into practice can take decades.

â€¢ Innovative approaches, like adaptive platform trials, can help us test and scale solutions much faster.

â€¢ Youth must be at the centre â€” not only as participants, but as co-designers and leaders in shaping mental health and climate responses.

At PRIME, we are working to build this platform: a space where researchers, clinicians, communities, and young people can come together to design and test interventions that are fit for purpose, evidence-based, and led by youth voices.

"Being part of PRIME has shown me that my climate anxiety isn't something I have to face alone. The group sessions helped me connect with other young people who understand what I'm going through." - Sarah, 19

"I learned practical strategies for managing my eco-grief while also finding ways to take meaningful action. It's about hope and agency, not just coping." - Marcus, 22

"The research process itself was empowering. We weren't just participants - we were partners in designing something that could help other young people." - Aisha, 17

These stories highlight the importance of youth-centered approaches and the power of peer support in building climate resilience.`,
