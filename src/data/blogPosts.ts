    fullContent: `We know that climate change is more than an environmental crisis â€” it's also a mental health challenge. Young people, in particular, are experiencing rising levels of anxiety, grief and hopelessness in the face of floods, bushfires, heatwaves and ongoing climate uncertainty.

Our new commentary, published in the Journal of Applied Youth Studies, calls for urgent action to close the gap between what young people are experiencing and the slow pace of research and policy responses.

We highlight that:

â€¢ <strong class="text-[#2D6AA3] font-semibold">Young people are disproportionately affected by climate-related disasters and exclusion from decision-making.</strong>

â€¢ <strong class="text-[#2D6AA3] font-semibold">Youth-specific interventions are rare, and translating research into practice can take decades.</strong>

â€¢ <strong class="text-[#2D6AA3] font-semibold">Innovative approaches, like adaptive platform trials, can help us test and scale solutions much faster.</strong>

â€¢ <strong class="text-[#2D6AA3] font-semibold">Youth must be at the centre â€” not only as participants, but as co-designers and leaders in shaping mental health and climate responses.</strong>

At PRIME, we are working to build this platform: a space where researchers, clinicians, communities, and young people can come together to design and test interventions that are fit for purpose, evidence-based, and led by youth voices.

    title: "Vulnerability and Psychosocial Impacts of Extreme Weather on Young People in Australia",
    excerpt: "A new open-access study using data from 19,501 teens (15â€“19 years) finds that adolescents exposed to floods, fires, storms or droughts report higher climate concerns, more psychological distress, and greater housing/financial challenges.",
    fullContent: `TL;DR: A new open-access study using data from 19,501 teens (15â€“19 years) finds that adolescents exposed to floods, fires, storms or droughts report higher climate concerns, more psychological distress, and greater housing/financial challengesâ€”with the biggest impacts when their household is directly affected.

What the study did

Researchers analysed the 2023 Mission Australia Youth Survey to see how exposure to extreme weather relates to mental health and social outcomes for young people across Australia.

Paper: Environmental Research (Open Access)

Title: Vulnerability and psychosocial impacts of extreme weather events among young people in Australia

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.121385

Key findings (in plain language)

Who's more likely to be exposed: Young people outside major cities, in lower-SES areas, who are Indigenous, gender diverse, living with disability, or from CALD communities.

Mental health impacts: Those exposed show higher climate concern and higher psychological distress (K6).

Practical impacts: Higher odds of financial hardship and housing challengesâ€”especially when impacts hit the household, not just the community.

Why this matters: Recovery can't be "one size fits all." Age-appropriate supports need to include mental health services, housing, and financial assistance, with extra attention to historically disadvantaged groups.

What this means for action

In recovery: Put youth mental health staff into disaster response and ensure culturally safe, age-appropriate supports.

In preparedness: Work with schools and local services to build coping skills, connection, and readiness tailored to local hazards.

In policy: Track youth outcomes after disasters and fund programs that target housing stability, financial supports, and equitable access to care.

"Being part of PRIME has shown me that my climate anxiety isn't something I have to face alone. The group sessions helped me connect with other young people who understand what I'm going through." - Sarah, 19

"I learned practical strategies for managing my eco-grief while also finding ways to take meaningful action. It's about hope and agency, not just coping." - Marcus, 22

"The research process itself was empowering. We weren't just participants - we were partners in designing something that could help other young people." - Aisha, 17

These stories highlight the importance of youth-centered approaches and the power of peer support in building climate resilience.`,
