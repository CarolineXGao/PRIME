    title: "Climate Change and Youth: Fast-Tracking Mental Health Solutions",
    excerpt:
      "Our new commentary calls for urgent action to fast-track youth mental health solutions in the climate crisis...",
    fullContent: `We know that climate change is more than an environmental crisis â€” it's also a mental health challenge. Young people, in particular, are experiencing rising levels of anxiety, grief and hopelessness in the face of floods, bushfires, heatwaves and ongoing climate uncertainty.

Our new commentary, published in the Journal of Applied Youth Studies, calls for urgent action to close the gap between what young people are experiencing and the slow pace of research and policy responses.

We highlight that:

<ul class="list-none space-y-1">
  <li>â€¢ Young people are disproportionately affected by <strong>climate-related disasters</strong> and <strong>exclusion from decision-making</strong>.</li>
  <li>â€¢ <strong>Youth-specific interventions</strong> are rare, and <strong>translation into practice</strong> can take decades.</li>
  <li>â€¢ <strong>Adaptive platform trials</strong> can help us <strong>test and scale solutions</strong> much faster.</li>
  <li>â€¢ Youth must be at the centre â€” not only as participants, but as <strong>co-designers</strong> and <strong>leaders</strong> in shaping responses.</li>
</ul>



At PRIME, we are working to build this platform: a space where researchers, clinicians, communities, and young people can come together to design and test interventions that are fit for purpose, evidence-based, and led by youth voices.

      "Vulnerability and Psychosocial Impacts of Extreme Weather on Young People in Australia",
    excerpt:
      "A new study of 19,501 Australian teens finds that exposure to extreme weather increases climate concerns and psychological distress.",
    fullContent: `A new open-access study of 19,501 Australian teens (15â€“19 years) shows that exposure to floods, fires, storms or droughts is linked to higher climate concern, greater psychological distress, and increased housing and financial challenges.

The research analysed the 2023 Mission Australia Youth Survey to understand how extreme weather exposure affects young peopleâ€™s mental health and social wellbeing.

We highlight that:

<ul class="list-none space-y-1">
  <li>â€¢ Adolescents <strong>outside major cities</strong>, in <strong>lower-SES areas</strong>, and those who are <strong>Indigenous</strong>, <strong>gender diverse</strong>, <strong>living with disability</strong>, or from <strong>CALD communities</strong> are more likely to be exposed.</li>
  <li>â€¢ Those exposed report <strong>higher climate concern</strong> and <strong>greater psychological distress (K6)</strong>.</li>
  <li>â€¢ Exposure increases the odds of <strong>financial hardship</strong> and <strong>housing challenges</strong> â€” especially when the household is directly affected.</li>
  <li>â€¢ Recovery cannot be <strong>"one size fits all"</strong>: supports must be <strong>age-appropriate</strong>, <strong>culturally safe</strong>, and <strong>targeted</strong> to vulnerable groups.</li>
</ul>

What this means for action:  
<ul class="list-none space-y-1">
  <li>- In <strong>recovery</strong>: place <strong>youth mental health staff</strong> in disaster response and provide <strong>culturally safe</strong>, <strong>age-appropriate supports</strong>.</li>
  <li>- In <strong>preparedness</strong>: work with <strong>schools</strong> and <strong>local services</strong> to build <strong>coping skills</strong> and readiness tailored to <strong>local hazards</strong>.</li>
  <li>- In <strong>policy</strong>: track <strong>youth outcomes</strong> after disasters and fund programs that support <strong>housing stability</strong>, <strong>financial security</strong>, and <strong>equitable care access</strong>.</li>
</ul>

    title: "Climate Concern, Distress, and Future Outlook in Young Australians",
    excerpt:
      "Study of 18,800 young Australians shows higher climate concern links to greater distress and negative outlook.",
    fullContent: `Using data from 18,800 Australians aged 15â€“19, higher climate concern is linked to greater psychological distress and a more negative outlookâ€”especially for gender-diverse, Indigenous, and young people living outside major cities.

This study analysed the 2022 Mission Australia Youth Survey to examine how climate change concerns relate to psychological distress (K6) and future outlook after accounting for social determinants and pre-existing mental health conditions.

Key findings:

<ul class="list-none space-y-1">
  <li>- <strong>One in four</strong> young people were very or extremely concerned about <strong>climate change</strong>.</li>
  <li>- <strong>Female</strong> and <strong>gender-diverse youth</strong>, and those with a <strong>self-reported mental health condition</strong>, reported higher climate concerns.</li>
  <li>- Very/extremely concerned youth had higher <strong>psychological distress</strong> .</li>
  <li>- They were also more likely to have a <strong>negative future outlook</strong> .</li>
  <li>- Associations were stronger among <strong>gender-diverse</strong>, <strong>Indigenous</strong>, and <strong>outer-regional/remote</strong> participants.</li>
</ul>

Why this matters:

<ul class="list-none space-y-1">
  <li>- <strong>Integrate youth mental health</strong> into <strong>climate policy</strong> â€” education, communication, and services should address <strong>climate-related distress</strong> and foster hope.</li>
  <li>- <strong>Track outcomes over time</strong> â€” <strong>longitudinal monitoring</strong> can guide effective responses and prevention.</li>

"Being part of PRIME has shown me that my climate anxiety isn't something I have to face alone. The group sessions helped me connect with other young people who understand what I'm going through." - Sarah, 19

"I learned practical strategies for managing my eco-grief while also finding ways to take meaningful action. It's about hope and agency, not just coping." - Marcus, 22

"The research process itself was empowering. We weren't just participants - we were partners in designing something that could help other young people." - Aisha, 17

These stories highlight the importance of youth-centered approaches and the power of peer support in building climate resilience.`,

    title: "Reflection on climate emotions",
    excerpt:
      "Our ancient instincts can trap us in fear or denial â€” or be transformed into courage and hope.",
    fullContent: `In times of great drought, Chinese communities turned to the Dragon King, sovereign of rivers and rain. Temples were raised, incense burned, offerings laid at his feet. Yet when the skies remained unbroken, stories tell of villages so desperate that they gave up their own children to the Dragon King, believing such a terrible sacrifice might summon the rains. To us, this feels unthinkable, even monstrous. But the story is not about cruelty â€” it is about the crushing weight of uncertainty. When people are powerless before forces larger than themselves, they cling to whatever explanations and remedies their culture provides, no matter how desperate or irrational.

    
This is not just a story of the past. It is a mirror for how we confront climate change today. Faced with fires, floods, and rising seas, many are overcome by grief and anxiety, unable to picture a safe future; some are swept into anger and blame. Still others retreat into denial, persuading themselves the danger is exaggerated or unreal. These reactions may seem opposed, but all arise from the same source: the ancient circuitry of the human mind, instincts honed to shield us when the world feels unbearably unsafe.
Our emotions were not designed for the slow violence of climate change â€” they were forged in the hunter-gatherer world. Fear kept our ancestors alive by sharpening attention to sudden threats. Anxiety prepared the body for swift action. Grief created rituals that bound communities together. Anger rallied courage to defend kin and territory. Even denial had its place, sparing the mind from terror when survival demanded focus on the immediate task. These were not flaws but finely tuned adaptations to an unpredictable world.

Carried into todayâ€™s crisis, however, the same instincts can overwhelm us. Fear immobilises. Anxiety spirals. Grief sinks into despair. Anger divides instead of uniting. Denial blinds us to what is unfolding before our eyes. Our evolutionary inheritance, once protective, now risks trapping us.

And yet, if we can recognise these ancient patterns, we can begin to master them. Fear can become courage. Anxiety can sharpen preparedness. Grief can draw us into collective renewal. Anger can fuel determination to protect what matters most. Even denial, when met with compassion rather than scorn, can soften into dialogue. These instincts are not enemies to silence but raw materials to guide â€” pathways that, if tended carefully, can lead us toward resilience and action.

The story of the Dragon King reminds us that people have always invented ways to survive the unbearable. What matters now is whether our stories will lock us into cruelty, paralysis or open us into action. To face the future, we need new rituals, new narratives that make climate reality livable, not unspeakable. Only then can we transform the ancient instincts of distress and denial into pathways for resilience, imagination, and hope.
